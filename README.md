Helper for code: 
We refer to each piece of content as a knowledge object. 
As we cannot provide our entire code base, we included in the repo only relevant pieces of code which handle Anthropic integrations:
Our Python backend Anthropic service for summarising each piece of content  and creating bundle summaries (with support for JSON based responses)
Our Python backend API for providing mobile applications with best prompts and dynamic management of model parameters for supporting Timestamps and Topics feature (episode show notes)
Our Dart frontend code for AI based chatbot with long and short summaries
Our Dary frontend code for generating Timestamps and Topics.
